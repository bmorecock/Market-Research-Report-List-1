<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Detector Tubes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Colorimetric Gas Detector Tubes</li><li>Dosimetric Gas Detector Tubes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas detector tubes are used to measure the presence and concentration of specific gases in the air. Colorimetric gas detector tubes rely on a chemical reaction between the gas being tested and a reagent within the tube, resulting in a color change that can be quantified. Dosimetric gas detector tubes, on the other hand, measure gas concentration over a period of time by absorbing the gas onto a sorbent material. Both types of tubes provide a quick and convenient method for gas detection and monitoring in various applications.</p></p>
