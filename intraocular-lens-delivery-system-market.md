<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intraocular Lens Delivery System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Preloaded Intraocular Lens Delivery System</li><li>Manually Loaded Intraocular Lens Delivery System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Intraocular Lens (IOL) Delivery System market is divided into two types: Preloaded Intraocular Lens Delivery System and Manually Loaded Intraocular Lens Delivery System. The Preloaded system consists of a ready-to-use IOL that is pre-loaded into the delivery system, making it convenient for surgeons as it eliminates the need for manual loading. On the other hand, the Manually Loaded system requires surgeons to manually load the IOL into the delivery system before implantation. Both types aim to aid surgeons in delivering IOLs during ocular surgeries, but differ in the loading process.</p></p>
