<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Piston Displacement Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lift Pump</li><li>Force Pump</li><li>Axial Piston Pump</li><li>Radial Piston Pump</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Piston displacement pumps are classified into four types based on their operational mechanisms. Lift pumps use a suction force to lift fluid from a lower level to a higher level. Force pumps create pressure by exerting force on the fluid directly. Axial piston pumps have pistons aligned in an axial direction which reciprocate to generate fluid flow. Radial piston pumps have pistons arranged radially around a central shaft and create pressure by moving radially in and out. These different pump types cater to various industrial applications and fluid handling requirements.</p></p>
