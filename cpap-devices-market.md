<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CPAP Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Pressure CPAP Device</li><li>Auto Adjusting CPAP Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CPAP devices, commonly used to treat sleep apnea, are available in two main types. Fixed pressure CPAP devices provide a constant, predetermined air pressure throughout the night. They are simple to use and often the most economical option. On the other hand, auto-adjusting CPAP devices, also known as APAP devices, continuously monitor the patient's breathing patterns and adjust the air pressure accordingly. These devices are more adaptable and can provide different pressure levels as needed, offering a more personalized and comfortable therapy experience.</p></p>
