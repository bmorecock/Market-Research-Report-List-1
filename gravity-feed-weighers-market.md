<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gravity Feed Weighers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gross Weight Scale</li><li>Net Weight Scale</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Gravity feed weighers are used in various industries to accurately measure and dispense products. There are two main types of gravity feed weighers: gross weight scale and net weight scale. </p><p>Gross weight scale functions by weighing the entire package, including the product and its packaging, resulting in the total weight. This type is suitable for applications where the weight of packaging needs to be included, such as labeling or freight calculations.</p><p>On the other hand, net weight scale measures only the product's weight, excluding the packaging. It is commonly used in industries where the weight of the product itself is essential, like food or pharmaceuticals, ensuring accurate portion control and complying with regulations.</p></p>
