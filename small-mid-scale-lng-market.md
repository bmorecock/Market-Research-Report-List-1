<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small-Mid Scale LNG Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefaction</li><li>Regasification</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Small-Mid Scale LNG refers to the liquefied natural gas industry catering to relatively smaller markets or regions. Liquefaction involves the process of cooling natural gas to extremely low temperatures, transforming it into a liquid state, and making it easier to store and transport. Regasification, on the other hand, is the process of converting the liquid LNG back into its original gaseous state for distribution and use. These processes enable the efficient utilization of natural gas resources in smaller markets or areas where traditional pipeline infrastructure may be limited or unavailable.</p></p>
