<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Lifts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pump Assisted</li><li>Gas Assisted</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Artificial lifts in the market are categorized into two main types: pump assisted and gas assisted. Pump assisted artificial lifts utilize mechanical pumps to extract oil or gas from wells by increasing the fluid pressure. On the other hand, gas assisted artificial lifts use injected gas, usually natural gas, to reduce the density of the fluid and help it flow to the surface. Both methods enhance production rates and improve the efficiency of oil and gas extraction processes.</p></p>
