<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The External Cardiac Pacemakers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Chamber Pacemakers</li><li>Dual Chamber Pacemakers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The external cardiac pacemakers market includes two main types: Single Chamber Pacemakers and Dual Chamber Pacemakers. Single Chamber Pacemakers are devices that regulate the heartbeat by delivering electrical pulses to the heart's lower chamber. Dual Chamber Pacemakers, on the other hand, monitor and regulate both the upper and lower chambers of the heart. These devices are crucial in managing abnormal heart rates and ensuring adequate blood flow.</p></p>

<p><strong>The External Cardiac Pacemakers Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bradycardia</li><li>Atrial Fibrillation</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The external cardiac pacemakers market is primarily divided into three major applications: bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, and others. Bradycardia refers to a condition where the heart beats too slowly, necessitating external pacemakers to regulate and maintain a normal heart rate. Atrial fibrillation, on the other hand, is a condition characterized by irregular and rapid heart rhythms that can also be managed using external pacemakers. The "others" category includes various cardiac conditions where external pacemakers are used to restore and control the heart's normal electrical activity.</p></p>
