<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cryo Traps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internally Cooled Cryo Traps</li><li>Externally Cooled Cryo Traps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cryo traps are devices used in chromatography to capture and concentrate volatile compounds. Internally cooled cryo traps are designed with an integrated cooling system, enabling them to reach very low temperatures internally. They offer efficient trapping and retention of analytes during sample preparation. Externally cooled cryo traps, on the other hand, do not have an integrated cooling system and require external cooling sources. They are generally less expensive and easier to maintain but may have lower trapping efficiencies compared to internally cooled traps.</p></p>
