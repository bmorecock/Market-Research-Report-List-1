<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Breast Silicone Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Silicone Breast Implants</li><li>Cohesive Silicone Gel Breast Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Breast silicone implants refer to medical devices used in breast augmentation or reconstruction surgeries. Silicone breast implants consist of a silicone outer shell filled with silicone gel, providing a soft and natural feel. On the other hand, cohesive silicone gel breast implants use a more cohesive and viscous type of silicone gel, which maintains its shape even if the implant ruptures. Both types of implants are used to enhance breast size and shape, but cohesive gel implants offer added safety and reduced risk of leakage.</p></p>
