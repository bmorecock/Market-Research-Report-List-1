<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bonded Seal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non Self Centralising Type</li><li>Self Centralising Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bonded seal market consists of two types: non-self centralising type and self-centralising type. The non-self centralising type does not have a built-in mechanism to maintain its central position during installation and relies on the tightening action to do so. On the other hand, the self-centralising type has a built-in feature that automatically positions itself at the center during installation, providing greater sealing efficiency. These different types cater to various industrial needs, ensuring effective sealing of connections.</p></p>
