<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electromotoric Valve Actuator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Type</li><li>Linear Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electromotoric valve actuator market consists of two major types: rotary and linear. A rotary actuator is designed to convert rotational motion into linear motion, allowing the valve to open or close in a circular motion. On the other hand, a linear actuator moves the valve in a straight line, either pushing or pulling it open or closed. Both types of actuators play a vital role in controlling the flow of fluids or gases in various industrial applications, providing efficient and precise valve control.</p></p>
