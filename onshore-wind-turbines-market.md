<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Onshore Wind Turbines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine</li><li>Vertical Axis Wind Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The onshore wind turbines market comprises two primary types: horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT) and vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT). HAWTs are the most commonly used, with blades that rotate horizontally to capture wind energy efficiently. They have higher energy conversion efficiency, larger capacity, and are suitable for open and constant wind flow areas. On the other hand, VAWTs have their blades positioned vertically, making them suitable for areas with complex wind directions or urban settings where wind directions change frequently. They are smaller in size and have lower energy conversion efficiency compared to HAWTs.</p></p>
