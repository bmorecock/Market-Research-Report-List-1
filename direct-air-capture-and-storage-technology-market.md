<p><strong>The Direct Air Capture and Storage Technology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Physical Absorption in Liquid Media</li><li>Adsorption on Solid Media</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Direct Air Capture and Storage (DACS) technology is a method that captures carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from the atmosphere. DACS market types can be categorized into two methods: physical absorption in liquid media and adsorption on solid media. </p><p>Physical absorption in liquid media involves the use of a liquid solvent that absorbs CO2 from the air, forming a solution. This captured CO2 can then be further processed for storage or utilized in various applications.</p><p>Adsorption on solid media relies on solid materials, such as activated carbon, which have a high affinity for CO2. When air passes through these materials, CO2 molecules adhere to the surface. The captured CO2 can later be released, stored, or used in different industries.</p><p>Both methods offer promising avenues for carbon capture and storage, aiding in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and combatting climate change.</p></p>
