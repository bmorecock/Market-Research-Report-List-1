<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hair Fixative Polymers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-ionic Polymer</li><li>Anionic Polymer</li><li>Cationic Polymer</li><li>Amphoteric Polymer</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hair fixative polymers are used in hair styling products to provide hold, volume, and texture to hair. There are four types of hair fixative polymers: non-ionic, anionic, cationic, and amphoteric. Non-ionic polymers do not carry a charge and are versatile in providing moderate hold. Anionic polymers carry a negative charge and are good for providing strong hold and volume. Cationic polymers carry a positive charge and are excellent for conditioning the hair while providing hold. Amphoteric polymers have both positive and negative charges, making them suitable for a range of hair types and styles.</p></p>
