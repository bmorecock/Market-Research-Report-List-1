<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The User Authentication Solution Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Factor Authentication</li><li>Two Factor Authentication</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single factor authentication is a user authentication solution that relies on one form of authentication, such as a password or PIN. It is the most common type of authentication but has vulnerabilities due to easy password cracking. Two factor authentication adds an additional layer of security by requiring two different forms of authentication, usually a password and a unique code sent to a user's phone. This provides stronger protection against unauthorized access, reducing the risk of identity theft and fraud.</p></p>
