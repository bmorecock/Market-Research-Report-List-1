<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prototyping Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cloud Based</li><li>Web Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Prototyping software refers to tools and platforms used to create interactive mockups or prototypes of software applications. There are two main types of prototyping software markets: cloud-based and web-based. Cloud-based prototyping software is hosted on remote servers and accessible through the internet, allowing users to work collaboratively and access their projects from any device with an internet connection. On the other hand, web-based prototyping software is typically installed on local computers or servers, limiting access to the software within a particular network or location. Both types offer advantages in terms of flexibility, accessibility, and ease of collaboration.</p></p>
