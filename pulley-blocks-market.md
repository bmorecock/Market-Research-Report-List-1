<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pulley Blocks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Moving Pulley</li><li>Fixed Pulley</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pulley Blocks are a type of mechanical device used to hoist or move objects. There are two main types of pulley blocks in the market: moving pulleys and fixed pulleys. Moving pulleys have a sheave that can rotate, allowing the pulley to move along with the load being lifted. This type of pulley provides mechanical advantage by reducing the amount of force required to lift heavy objects. On the other hand, fixed pulleys do not move and are used to change the direction of the force applied to lift an object.</p></p>
